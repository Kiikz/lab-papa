User Story (ðŸ‘• medium-large)
- As a dev team
- I want to perform CRUD operations from the APP
- So that you can witness the power of this fully operational battle station

Narrative

Terms
APP = deployed live in production via HEROKU <br>
CRUD = create-read-update-delete, your basic DB operations <br>
CRUD from APP = an autonomous data source (prob. MongoDB via Atlas) connects to Node, routed via Express, to EJS view, & back again. <br>

What data? <br>
Anything, proof-of-concpet <br>
could start thinking about dev profiles = name, github username, links, certs, skills, enneagram type
